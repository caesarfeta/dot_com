# dot com

### Requirements
* Python 2.6+
* Jinja2-2.7.1
* Markdown-2.3.1
* Foundation 3.2.5

### What it does.
This project is my personal website.
It's a database free blogging system.
It uses JSON and Markdown files to store content.
A couple of Python scripts and Jinja2 templates take the JSON and Markdown and builds the HTML files that are "the site."
The site's visual aesthetic is simple and book-like.
