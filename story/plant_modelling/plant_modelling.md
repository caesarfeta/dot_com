##L-Systems

Full name Lindenmayer system.
Named after a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist named Aristid Lindenmayer.

### What are they?

A way of modelling natural patterns using sequences of symbols.
These symbols define shapes which are drawn a specified number of times in a way that simulate shapes and textures found in nature.

The traditional L-System algorithm requires three parameters.

Plants are marvelous structures.
I'm not a religious man but I do believe that if anything should be deemed sacred and worthy of our worship it's the plant kingdom.
Let me share with you my perspective.
Plants convert radiant light into stored chemical energy to fuel their life support systems.
Removing plants from a light source will kill them.
	-- Kill them is a loaded word.
	
From a miniscule seed the largest living organisms on planet Earth, and as far as we know... the universe, are grown.

[FROM WIKIPEDIA] 
	"A superorganism is an organism consisting of many organisms. 
	This is usually meant to be a social unit of eusocial animals, 
		where division of labour is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods of time.\"

Organism
Greek -- organon -- tool, instrument, sense organ

eusocial - adjective - Zoology
	(of an animal species, esp. an insect) showing an advanced level of social organization, in which a single female or caste produces the offspring and nonreproductive individuals cooperate in caring for the young.

It can be argued that most organisms are superorganisms.
Many animals can only digest cellulose with the help of genetically distinct bacteria in their guts.
Cellulose is the primary energy source for these animals.
Gut bacteria have most certainly influeced the evolution of their home.

It can be argued that most human institutions are superorganisms.
We call our factories "plants" for good reason.
Industrial "plants" can be thought of as superorganisms.

Each plant species has a distinct structure and lifecycle that has evolved alongside all other species in its environment.
The drive to acquire the materials and energy necessary for individual growth and collective reproduction is what creates their forms.
	How tall they will grow
	The shape of their leaves
	The anchoring strenght of their roots

Vines cannot exist without trees or other well anchored plants.
	
Every structure in Nature has a purpose... a reason.
It is in our best interest as a species and as individuals to understand these structures.
	Their reason for being.
	Their applications in manufacturing our own living environments.
	
Their inherent mathematical and aesthetic beauty has been an inspiration for the greatest works of art and the most practical tools of day-to-day living.

Most  digital modelling of plants is done using L-Systems.  L-Systems
