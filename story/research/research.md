# Scientific research in the Internet age
* The Internet has changed a lot in my lifetime.
* HTTP protocol was originally designed for transmission of documents in a mesh network.
	* aka sharing prepared documents among networked computers.
	* It's still used primarily for that purpose, but few people anticipated, at HTTPs birth, that it would become the preferred way for gathering and linking raw data.

## Scientific Research and HTTP


## Research application design principles.

* Make applications modular.
* Build APIs.
* Document your APIs.
	* Know your audience.
		* How experienced are they?
		* How patient are they?
* Make your application data machine-readable and easily accessible.
	* Building humancentric views into the data is easy with the right foundation.


## Foundational values, beliefs, and habits.
* Solitary genius is a myth.
* Promote your work not your "self."
* Collaborate with people you respect.
* If you find yourself big-fish in a little pond... find a bigger pond.
* Challenge is external.  Frustration is internal.
* Making money is secondary to building elegant life-enhancing systems.
* "Walled-gardens" are created by selfish ass-hats.
* Share your source code.
* Share your data.
	
* Monolithic == destined for replacement.
* Occham's Razord aka "Keep things as simple as possible."
* Communicate clearly and admit ignorance ALWAYS.
* Things always take longer than expected.
* Projects never end. They're either abandoned and forgotten or given to someone else to continue.

## Stuff to investigate
* Linked data will eventually come around.
	* RDF
	* JSON-LD
	* Ontologies
		* What are they?
			* Published datamodels associated with a URL
