					<p>Honey bees are fascinating.  I could gab about them for hours, and I will... if you're a very slow reader.</p>
<p>First of all they are so organized that Martha Stewart is envious. 
They have division of labor. 
Like Indians they use a strict caste system.<br />
Unlike Indians their caste system isn't just racism and power politics masquerading as religious tradition. 
Bee castes go much deeper than that.</p>
<p>There's royalty of course, the queen.
We all know her.
She's the one doted on by the rest of the hive because of her big fertile behind.
She's worshipped as their fertility goddess.
Unlike our fertility goddesses, Oprah, she has taken up the burden of having children.</p>
<h3>The Queen</h3>
<p>Here's some fascinating facts about queen bees.
Queen bee larva get a special cell in the honeybee hive, the queen cup.
It looks like a Cheez Ball with a hole in it.
The queen bee larva gets to develop in her special cup and is given the finest of bee delicacies to consume, royal jelly.
All bees get fed royal jelly.
It's secreted from the heads of worker bees.
Larvae of other castes get just tiny tastes here and there.
It's fed to them like a communion wafer to a devout catholic,
but the queen bee larvae is completely bathed in it.
Her queen cup is filled to its brim.
Queen bee larvae and the larvae of worker bees have the same DNA, but if you feed larvae large enough quantities of royal jelly to bee larva it will develop into queen bee.
It gets fertile ovaries.</p>
<h3>The Drones</h3>
<p>Then there are the drones. 
Drones are bees who are out to stud.
They're gigolos who kind of just take it easy and occasionally have sex with the queen.
You know that saying, "busy as a bee".
Well that doesn't really apply to these guys.</p>
<p>Interesting fact about drones.
Their eyes are twice as large as other bees.
They're the big dewey-eyed teenage heart-throbs of the honey bee world.</p>
<h3>The Workers</h3>
<p>And finally there's a huge army of nameless female bees who are individually disposable and do most of the work maintaining the hive.
They're named, aptly, the workers.
Sound familiar, ladies?</p>
<h3>The "Waggle Dance"</h3>
<p>Bees can communicate directions to sources of food by gathering a group of bees into a circle and spinning around in a very organized pattern.
It's called their "waggle dance".
The amount and frequency of their spins are their turn-by-turn GPS directions, 
or if you prefer a sequence of vector coordinates, 
aka numbers indicating direction and distance, 
in relation to the sun.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second.
That's like telling your friends how to get to your favorite pizza place by breakdancing.</p>
<h3>Kamikaze Pilots</h3>
<p>Bees are also kamikaze pilots.<br />
To defend their hive they will attack invading animals with a barbed stinger. 
As a reward for their selflessness and bravery in battle they get their vital organs pulled out their backsides.
The barbed stinger gets so lodged in their enemy that when they fly away</p>
<p>We are dependent on them to pollinate most of our fruits and vegetables. 
I'm sure some corporation, probably Monsanto, has filed a patent for using mechanical 'drones', 
aka RC helicopters piloted by computer software, to pollinate plants, 
because we're killing honey bees off in droves with industrial agricultural pollution.</p>
<p>What makes them truly amazing in my opinion is the homes they build.</p>
<p>Honey bee hives are constructed out of hexagonal cells, and are very efficient structures.
Perhaps the most efficient structures.</p>
<h3>Hexagons</h3>
<p>Why hexagaons and not squares you may be wondering...
Well checkout this video.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAyDi1aa40E</p>
<p>In wonder if city planners could make use of this information.
Why are we laying out city streets in grids with 90 degree angles instead of 120 degree angles?
What is our fascination with right angles?
They're very limiting.
Is it because of agriculture?
Are we so used to walking behind a plow in long straight lines that we decided to use them for our transportation networks?
How do we connect all these rows of straight lines?
Usually just with more straight lines.</p>
<h3>Getting Off The Grid</h3>
<p>It's very unnatural to have structures reaching into the sky arranged on a perfect grid.
That doesn't happen in nature unless humans have intervened.
You'll see trees growing in long straight lines in orchards, which I suppose make them easier to maintain and harvest.
But it isn't just efficiency, a row of trees helps mark personal property.
Somebody wandering through the publically owned woods who comes across rows of straight trees will know that they are now on someone's "personal property", and that foraging has now become stealing.
It's marking territory.
The man pushing a lawnmower in a grid over a useless grassy front lawn every Saturday morning is doing the same thing.
He has to let the neighbors know this is his residence, the place where most of his biological activity takes place.
To be blunt about it he's letting other people know, "Hey!  This is where I do most of my eating, sleeping, shitting, and fucking!"</p>
<p>We use rectangles, cubes, and grids like this all the time.
What's a great painting without a frame?
Why it's incomplete.
When we give each other gifts we usually put them in boxes with right angles.
We wrap them up and put a little bow on them.</p>
<p>Deviations from the right angle trend are seen as <em>exotic</em>.
Chinese food containers and the rich white person equivalent are exceptions.</p>
<p>Gift bags have become popular these days.
Ever see a gift bag that looks like an amorphous sac?
I don't.  I see flimsy boxes with one side cut off.</p>
<p>The exchanging of right angles marks the exchange of property.
Imagine signing a mortgage contract on a circular piece of paper.
That would probably be unsettling.
How is one supposed to file a circle?</p>
<p>There is something mechanical and lazy about using rectilinear grids.
Its efficient for travel in an automobile.
It also makes directions easier to follow, but there are draw backs certainly.
There are places that buck this trend.
I live just outside of Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<h3>City Planning</h3>
<p>Hexagonal streets would be great for pedestrians.
Barcelona has a neighborhood nicknamed L'Example where the corners of intersecting streets are chamfered producing octagonal mini-plazas.
It makes for more casual strolling.
The chamfered areas usually are home to outdoor seating for restaurants, parking spaces for delivery vehicles, or the occasional park bench.
Buildings on these corners are desired pieces of real-estate and are usually beautifully decorated in art-deco motifs.</p>
<p>Tree growth in Nature is probably best modeled as circles radiating outwards until blocked by some ecological barrier a river, a rival tree species, or changes in soil.</p>
