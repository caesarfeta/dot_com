sputter coated?

"Sputter coating is where you place a specimen in a vacuum chamber, 
that has usually a gold/palladium alloy that gets bombarded with heavy gas atoms (usually argon) 
which makes sort of a beam of metal atoms that coat whatever is below them in a super thin layer of the metal. 
This coating looks a lot like the appearance of your beetle 
and it helps when you put your specimen into an SEM so it doesn't "charge" from the electron beam."
