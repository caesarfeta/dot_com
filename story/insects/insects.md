I decided to compile this list of arthropod ( insects, spiders, millipedes and centipedes ) species.  They, along with yours truly, live in the great state of Massachusetts. I want to get to know my neighbors, so each week I'm going to profile a different species!

I'll be compiling the best photographs of each I can find.  I'll do a little research

I'm not a professional entomologist.  I'm just a guy who likes bugs, Nature, numbers, drawing and making jokes.
If you find any egregious errors let me know. Also if you know of good sources of information, or you're interested in some kind of collaboration contact me too.

Also most of my photographs are snatched from <a href="http://eol.org">eol.org</a>.  It's a wonderful site.  If you prefer your insect learnin' to be done with scientific rigor and hard data go there.
