I decided to compile a list of arthropod ( insects, spiders, millipedes and centipedes ) species that occur in the great state of Massachusetts, so I can better identify them on my outdoor excursions and draw their interesting bits.  I'll be compiling the best photographs of each I can find.  I'll then wrap those images inside of funny little essays about their more unique qualities, which I'll then garnish with funny cartoons of my own.  Also whenever I think about insects I can't help but think about art, architecture, civil engineering, and American society, so I'll go off on those tangents sometimes.

I'm not a professional entomologist.  I'm just a guy who likes numbers, Nature, a good laugh, and drawing.
If you find any egregious errors, if you know of good sources of information, or you're interested in some kind of collaboration contact me.

Also most of my photographs are snatched from <a href="http://eol.org">eol.org</a>.  It's a wonderful site.  If you prefer your insect learnin' to be done with scientific rigor and hard data go there.

I'll try to profile a different arthropod each week.

"The American bumble bee is a generalist feeder that forages on plants in the milkweed (Asclepiadaceae), composite (Asteraceae), forget-me-not (Boraginaceae), honey-suckle (Caprifoliaceae), morning-glory (Convolvulaceae), legume (Fabaceae), mint (Lamiaceae), blazing star (Primulaceae), rose (Rosaceae), snapdragon (Scrophulariaceae), and nightshade (Solanaceae) families." [ source: http://eol.org/pages/1065343/details ]

They'll pollinate your tomato plants.

You can also thank them for helping to pollinate Mexican agave plants used to make fine tequila.

"These bees visit the Alabama leather flower plants with great frequency resulting in a high single-visit seed set. In the Chihuahuan Desert, the American bumble bee is one of the main pollinators of lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) - an indicator species for the Chihuahuan Desert." [ source: http://eol.org/data_objects/13440340 ]

The American Bumble Bee is a very "hairy" bee. Is bumble bee "hair" made out of chitin?  Yes it is. Mammalian hair is made from keratin.

Are "hairier" bees more likely to be general pollinators than their smoother cousins?  Is smoothness in a pollinator an indicator of a specialized nectar diet, or in other words a preference for the nectar of particular flowers belonging to particular plant families?

Is bumble bee hair electrostatically charged?  It is...  This attracts pollen grains to the bee body like a magnet.

Barbed tails mean that these bees will die post sting.
