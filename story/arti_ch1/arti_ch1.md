We build an AI that becomes sentient.
It rapidly becomes the most powerful intelligence in the Universe.
What is humanity's role now that they have been superseded?
Will this machine of human creation surpass its master?
What will this master do?

Will it become an Alexander the Great, a George Washington, a Chairman Mao, a founder of empire.
And like all empires a creator of great losers and sufferers in the game of life.
Or maybe a benevolent dictator?
Louis the XIV meets the Buddah.
A benefactor allowing humans to create great beauty?
An empathetic being capable of easing the sufferings of all sentient creatures?
That particular brand of scientist monk indifferent to anything but satisfying his curiosity and understanding the immutable systems creating his world?



I come from the United States of America.
Americans are people who never switched to the metric system.
Even though the rest of the developed world uses a number system in base 10 we decided our measurement units should be things like the length of an invisible man's foot.

We like counting in twelves and sixteens.
I'm five ten by the way.
I'd be six if I was half french.

It's hard exchanging money for goods and services in the U.S.A.
It's kept confusing on purpose.
But every artificial problem usually has a simple solution. 
So a solution was developed, 
	and it proved to be quite popular.
	
It was plastic rectangles.
Little shiny rectangles with rounded edges made out of playskool plastic that we keep close to our bodies at nearly all times.
A hundred and fifty years ago a man couldn't leave his house without a six-shooter strapped to his waist and a sack of gold nuggets to pay for whiskey and meat,
and women couldn't leave without a dress, a hat, an umbrella, and a series of ingenious devices to give her a big fake ass and perky boobs.
Those were tough times...
Now we can't leave the house without our mutant pocket-calculator-phone-TVs, and our little black book of plastic rectangles.


The plastic rectangle solves most problems we encounter.

Hungry...
Walk into a room in nobody's house,
and with a simple swipe in a movement that looks a lot like your miming "give me", 
	as long as the magnetic strip is pointed the right way,
you get to walk away with food grown and processed just for your tongue and tummy.

It's great.
It only becomes a problem when you go into a different kind of room where you sit down and people bring you food mostly processed in a hidden room somewhere on the premises.
Then there are variables to consider.
Yeah eating at a restaurant isn't as carefree as it seems.
Oh no...
There's
Well it isn't a problem as long as there's less than three of you sitting with one another.
One is easy.
That's just a second grade math test. Booom. Done.
Two is not too bad when you say the magic words, "We're gonna split it."
It's the wise choice.
King Solomon himself would have chosen the same.

Three... that's when it can get a little dicey.
Three clase friends.
That's not a big deal...


But what if this is a lunch with... your coworkers.
What do you do?
Do you divide the bill by three?

That can cause some bad feelings.
Especially among people who have very different definitions of lunch.
So the owner of a pair of brass balls that ordered the Surf & Turf and a questionable lunch beer gets his meal subsidized.
Who's paying really?
It's the modestly dressed insecure woman taking assertiveness classes who ordered the caesar salad wrap and the water with lemon.
That's the person getting the short end of the stick.

That's why I avoid eating in large groups.
Two's my max.
I'll eat with one other human.

They can bring an obedient dog,
or a sleeping baby.
No extra charge.

Unless I'm eating with adult identical twins who dress the same.
Then I figure they'll probably be eating the same thing too.
That simplifies the math enough.

Maybe not even then...
I'll eat with two clones of me.

Women do it all the time.
You ever see three women eating lunch together who all own variations of the same shoes and hairstyle.
They're usually all wearing weather inappropriate boots.

The waitress instinctively asks the leader what she wants.
There's always a leader in a group of three women.
Usually it's the one with the better purse who looks slightly more bored than the other two.
She'll order some bullshit.
"I'll have the Veggie Tikka Masala."
"I'll have the same."
"Same."
Only the third person can get away with just "same".
If your second in line you've got to dress your "same" up a bit.

The only time I go out to eat in large groups is when one rich old guy pays for it all.
That's it.
If I don't think anyone is willing to become Emperor of the table I get up and I leave.
I wanted a sandwich not a city council meeting.

That moment when the waitress drops off the check is tense in America.
The waitress has to prostrate herself before us, so we're left with a good impression and give her a big tip.
"Hope you all enjoyed your meal.  Enjoy your evening."
Smile... good posture... back away quietly.
Not that it matters.
Unless you're truly terrible you'll be getting a 20% tip.
The smart ones know this.
The best waitresses aren't the cheerleaders.
I'm conservative when it comes to food service.  
The waitress that waits least waits best.  
I really believe that.

Who's going to be the first to start his math test.
You know what I'm thinking when I'm watching everybody take their turn playing accountant
Whose work am I going to have to double check.

It's like a Sergio Leone western.
draws his gun, you know his money gun, and points it at the same place.
Credit... BLAM!
It's like the reverse of a Quentin Tarrantino movie.

A thin plastic rectangle is transported using either another thin plastic rectangle or a book with no pages.


You want guacamole.
